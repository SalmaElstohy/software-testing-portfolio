# Software Testing Portfolio
# About Me

I chose software testing because it matches my analytical mindset and attention to detail. I have experience testing systems across E-commerce, Booking, and Logistics domains. I focus on identifying real defects, validating business flows, and ensuring system reliability through structured testing, clear bug reporting, and effective communication. I take ownership of my work and deliver accurate, reliable results in every project.

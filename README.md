# About Me

I didn’t choose software testing just because of a passion for software. I chose it because it fits my analytical mindset and attention to detail. Through my experience, I’ve worked on testing systems across different business domains, including E-commerce, Booking, and Logistics. I focus on identifying real defects, validating business flows, and ensuring system reliability through structured testing, clear bug reporting, and effective communication. I’m committed to accuracy, responsibility, and continuously improving my testing skills to deliver quality results.

# About Me

I didn’t choose software testing just because of a passion for software. I chose it because it fits my analytical mindset and attention to detail. Through my experience, I’ve worked on testing systems across different business domains, including E-commerce, Booking, and Logistics. I focus on identifying real defects, validating business flows, and ensuring system reliability through structured testing, clear bug reporting, and effective communication. I’m committed to accuracy, responsibility, and continuously improving my testing skills to deliver quality results.

My Experience 

I am currently a junior software tester at Moltaqa Company , where I have contributed to multiple business-driven digital platforms, gaining hands-on experience across various domainsincluding service booking platforms, logistics, marketplaces, and admin dashboards, where I was responsible for verifying functionalities, ensuring smooth operations, and reporting any defects. This experience has strengthened my interest in the QA path and enhanced my ability to understand different business processes.
